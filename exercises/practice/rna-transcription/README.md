# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/coq).

## Checking the solution (testing everything)

To see if your solution works you just need to compile every file.

```bash
coqc *.v
```

There is no additional testing step needed as we can offload all testing to the type checker!
